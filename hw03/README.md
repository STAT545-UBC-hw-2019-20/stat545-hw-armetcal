# STAT 545 Homework #3
## Working with dplyr, ggplot2

**Author:** Avril Metcalfe-Roach

**Date:** 1 Oct 2019

#### Assignment Overview
This assignment will use dplyr (via tidyverse) and ggplot2 pacakges to perform three analyses of the gapminder dataset, and the results will be compiled into a published html webpage.

Each analysis will produce a tibble (dplyr), accompanying plot (ggplot2), and a written explanation of the data. 
*Note: just for fun, the first tibble was reformatted as a kable for aesthetic purposes using `knitr::kable()`.*
