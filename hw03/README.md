# STAT 545 Homework #3
## Working with dplyr, ggplot2

The website that hosts Assignment 3 can be found [here](https://armetcal.github.io/html_hw/). 

The linked website uses the repository html_hw, which was created in order to host all upcoming html-based assignments. A new repository was created as my previous assignments included *date* variables in the files that preceded today's date, which causes an error when publishing to Github Pages; creating a new repository was easier than changing every existing file!
