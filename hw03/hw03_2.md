### Task Option 5: Life Expectancy over Time, Per Continent

The gapminder dataset was used to identify how life expectancy has changed over time, on a per-continent basis.


```
## # A tibble: 60 x 4
## # Groups:   Continent [5]
##    Continent  Year `Avg Life Exp` `Std Dev Life Exp`
##    <fct>     <int>          <dbl>              <dbl>
##  1 Africa     1952           39.1                5.2
##  2 Africa     1957           41.3                5.6
##  3 Africa     1962           43.3                5.9
##  4 Africa     1967           45.3                6.1
##  5 Africa     1972           47.5                6.4
##  6 Africa     1977           49.6                6.8
##  7 Africa     1982           51.6                7.4
##  8 Africa     1987           53.3                7.9
##  9 Africa     1992           53.6                9.5
## 10 Africa     1997           53.6                9.1
## # ... with 50 more rows
```

This ugly table summarizes the life expectancy per continent, per year by including the Avg Life Expectancy (`mean(lifeExp)`) and the Std Deviation of the Life Expectancy (`sd(lifeExp)`). Values were rounded to the nearest 0.1 year.

The change in life expectancy per continent was then graphed in a line chart:

Error bars were included to indicate the spread of the data. The life expectancy of all continents increases over time, and most continents experience a reduction in the spread of life expectancies, indicating less disparity between different countries. African life expectancies, however, become more variable over time.

It is also interesting to note that all continents except for Africa seem to have converging life expectancies.
